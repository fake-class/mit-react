# Tiny Projects

> very rough draft

Tiny projects to practice investigative DS projects from beginning to end. The
main focus is collaboration, project life-cycle, data exploration, and
communicating results. Technical aspects are kept as simple as possible (to the
point of being too simple) so you are free to focus on the big picture.

A tiny project is a chance to connect the theory and technical details you are
learning with the world around them. It’s important you choose the subject of
each project so you can investigate things they know and care about.

## The Big Picture

## Triple Diamond

You will practice a three-phase approach to investigative data science. Each
phase is split into two parts:

- **Divergent Thinking**: Explore without saying "no". Try crazy ideas, learn
  and listen without judgement. By the end of this phase you should have a broad
  understanding of the what you are working on.
- **Convergent Convergent**: Narrow down your understanding and start saying
  "no". By the end of this phase you should have a narrow definition of what you
  were working on.

## Project Phases

Each project will follow the same phases, but have have different data,
questions, analysis and audience.

1. **Planning**: Align and prepare as a team
   - > pre-summarize project in 3 statements
     - the question you will ask
     - who you will answer to
     - what action you expect
   - Agree on the questions you will investigate
   - Agree on your motivations & desired results, is the purpose to …
     - Simply understand what’s happening?
     - Convince someone to take action?
     - Advise someone on the best course of action?
     - other?
   - If you have hypotheses, make sure they’re falsifiable
   - Define the domain in which you will be working
   - Clearly define who you will communicate your results to and why
   - Agree on project constraints
   - Create a communication plan for your group
   - Set up the technical baseline of your project (repo, automations, …)
2. **Domain & Data**: Study the relevant domain and determine how it can be
   modeled for your question
   - Do you have access to domain experts who can advise?
   - Collect reference materials for your group to study
   - Learn what data exists in the domain and how it’s collected
   - Understand limitations to the data available and think of how to deal with
     them
   - Define how you will model the data for your investigation in the following
     phase
   - Collect the data you will use. this could be as simple as a survey!
   - Put systems in place to store and manage your data
3. **Analysis & Results**: Investigate the data and try answering your questions
   - Be prepared for inconclusive or unwelcome results!
   - First do exploratory analyses of the data to understand what is there
     without assumption
   - Refine your questions & hypotheses as you learn more about the data
   - Agree on and document your approach for the analysis (flowcharts are
     helpful)
   - your analysis could be as simple as some bar graphs and basic stats!
   - Run the analysis and accept the results
4. **Audience & Communication**: Find the best way to communicate your results
   to your audience:
   - Get to know who you’ll be presenting to.
     - What is their background?
     - What decisions can they make, or not make?
     - Will they like the outcomes of your analysis?
   - Think of the story you will tell them, and how you want them to respond:
     - Should they change their minds?
     - Should they take action? What actions?
     - Should they be challenged? Reassured?
   - Think of how you will present the story:
     - Slide show?
     - Interactive visualization?
     - A theater play?
   - Create and refine the story.
     - Present it
     - Understand your audiences’ reaction
5. **Retrospective**: Reflect on the project and prepare to do better next time
   - Stop Doing
   - Continue Doing
   - Start Doing
   - What parts of your plan went as expected?
   - What parts of your plan needed to change?
   - Lessons Learned
