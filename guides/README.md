# Guides

The group projects you will work on will help you understand investigative data
science projects from beginning to end. The main focus is collaboration, project
planning/scoping, and communicating your results effectively.

You should keep the technical aspects of your project as simple as possible so
you can finish your projects on schedule, and so you are free to focus on _the
big picture_:
